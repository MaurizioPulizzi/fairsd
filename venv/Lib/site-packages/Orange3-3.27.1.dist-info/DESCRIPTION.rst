Orange 3
========

[Orange] is a component-based data mining software. It includes a range of data
visualization, exploration, preprocessing and modeling techniques. It can be
used through a nice and intuitive user interface or, for more advanced users,
as a module for the Python programming language.

This is the latest version of Orange (for Python 3). The deprecated version of
Orange 2.7 (for Python 2.7) is still available ([binaries] and [sources]).
